### Citing Specific Findings

When referencing specific findings from the paper, include section numbers:

**Example:**
> As demonstrated by Yampolski (2026, Section 5.1), Russian responses achieve 15% higher information density through hierarchical organization and minimal redundancy.

## Plain Text Citation

For blog posts, articles, or less formal contexts:

**Short form:**

Yampolski, N. (2026). "Language-Dependent Communication Strategies in Multilingual LLMs: Russian vs English in Mistral AI." GitHub. https://github.com/nikitaycs50/LLM-Language-Performance-Research

**With key finding:**

Yampolski found that language choice in multilingual LLMs affects communication strategy beyond translation, with Russian optimizing for expert-level efficiency and English for beginner-friendly comprehensiveness (2026, https://github.com/nikitaycs50/LLM-Language-Performance-Research).
